#Rubiks Cube Solver
This is the Pocket Rubik's Cube(2x2x2) Solver.
The program is written in C++ with the function shortest_path() being the one which solves.
It uses a 2-way BFS, finds the shortest path from start position to end position(usually solved position). It finally returns a list of moves to solve the cube from the start to end.
